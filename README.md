# Task2_GRIP_Jan21
It is the code walkthrough of an unsupervised machine learning of Task 2 provided by The Sparks Foundation as the part of Graduate Rotational Internship Program January 2021.  The IRIS data set is loaded and basic EDA is carried out using Pandas and  NumPy.  After EDA,  I have predicted the optimum number of clusters and represented it visually.
